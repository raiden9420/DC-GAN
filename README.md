# DC-GAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network)

This repository contains an implementation of a **Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DC-GAN)** built using **PyTorch**. The model is designed to generate realistic images by training a Generator and a Discriminator in a competitive setting.

## Overview

DC-GAN is a class of CNNs that has certain architectural constraints, and is a strong candidate for unsupervised learning. In this project, the network is trained to synthesize images from random noise, striving to mimic the distribution of the training data.

### Key Features:
- **Architecture**: Implements the standard DC-GAN architecture with transposed convolutions in the generator and strided convolutions in the discriminator.
- **Framework**: Developed using PyTorch and Torchvision.
- **Visualization**: Real-time progress tracking of loss functions and generated image samples.
- **Model Checkpoints**: Saves the latest generator state for inference.

## Dataset

The model is trained on the **CelebA (CelebFaces Attributes) Dataset**.

- **Description**: CelebA is a large-scale face attributes dataset with more than **200,000 celebrity images**, each with **40 attribute annotations**.
- **Content**: The images cover large pose variations and background clutter.
- **Usage**: In this project, the images are preprocessed (resized/cropped) to feed into the DC-GAN for training the generator to produce new, synthetic celebrity faces.

*(Note: Ensure you have the dataset downloaded and the path configured correctly in the notebook)*

## Project Structure

- `dc-gan.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing the model definition, training loop, and visualization.
- `Results DC GAN/`:
    - `Output Images/`: Contains grids of images generated by the model during different epochs.
    - `Loss Outputs/`: Contains plots or logs of the Generator and Discriminator loss.
    - `generator_latest.pth`: The trained weights for the Generator network.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the dependencies via pip:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/raiden9420/DC-GAN.git
   ```
2. Open the `dc-gan.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.
3. Run all cells to start the training process.
4. Generated results will be saved in the `Results DC GAN/` directory.

## Results

The model produces grids of synthetic images as training progresses. You can find the sample outputs in the `Results DC GAN/Output Images/` folder to witness the evolution of the generator's ability to create realistic patterns.
